The new algorithm needs to support bidirectional use statements. Current
support is based around one invariant. This holds only for forward use
statements. The depth-first approach exploits the invariant. The problem
comes from the possibility for leaf modules to contain use statements.
These were previously also considered. But previously these were
guaranteed to be unresolvable import statements. These refer to use
statements that target items from third-party crates. But bidirectional
imports means there are also backward use statements. These may refer to
some item in an ancestor module. And these are resolvable use
statements. The one thing relying on this the most is the single-module
resolution proposition. It bottoms out on the list of child modules. It
resoves leaf modules first. Then it bubbles back up. Ancestor module
then get resolved with the guarantee of a fully resolved subtree. This
needs to change. But prior notes revealed order matters not. To start
resolution from the crate root does not improve things. The ideal
resolution process is fairly clear. One import gets resolved. If the
target gets some changes within it then the source of the import
observes those changes. This may seem like it calls for nifty pointer
tricks. But a pure solution is preferred. One must specify what it means
to "observe" the changes in the target. Currently target merging implies
use statement removal. That means the whole thing is settled once a
target is found. But it does not have to be this way. A target may be
merged without need for use statement removal. The pass system observes
the number of use statements before and after a pass. This should in
theory prevent potential infinite loops. But that only holds under one
condition. Single-module resolution currently never goes through the
same module again. To "observe" the changes in the use statement target
requires another pass over the use statement source module. And yet
preservation of the use-statement implies no changes to the list of use
statements. So the pass system concludes the remaining use statements
are unresolvable. It then moves on to another module. This implies the
overarching flow of resolution through the module tree has to be thought
anew. It is insufficient for a given number of passes over a module to
all happen consecutively. But keeping track of the tree nodes that
potentially require another pass is a hassle. It is best if the
top-level call to resolve the module tree from the crate root is
changed. It should loop over all modules in the tree instead of over a
single module. It should be made into a potentially non-terminating
loop. A check would be performed after one full module pass were
performed. This would be very similar to the one currently used in the
pass system. But it would instead recursively check the lists of use
statements of all modules in the tree. If they all compared the same
then it would be safe to say the algorithm may now terminate. The point
here would be to exploit deduplication. An abstract example may be in
order. Consider the algorithm is at the crate root. It finds a
dependency-free reexport. This means the reexport can be immediately
resolved. And it chooses to resolve the reexport. This means it will be
produced as a resolution item. This item will then be merged into the
module in which the use statement appeared at. But here's the difference
with the prior revision of the algorithm. The use statement is not
removed. It is instead kept as-is. The termination condition in the
single module resolution proposition is then removed. A single pass is
the only pass ever performed on a given module. It is within one global
module tree pass. The termination check is then moved to the top-level
resolution proposition. This is the one that originally called into the
former with the crate root. But now it has been made into an "infinite"
loop. The termination condition stops being the number of use statements
pre- and post-pass. It becomes a full comparison of the module tree
before and after the global resolution pass. This should reveal whether
some module has had its list of items modified. The trick here would be
to perform deduplication everytime a single-module pass is done. This
would ensure one can merge one use statement over and over again without
tricking this check into believing there have been changes. The details
of this are still fuzzy. Further specification is required. Consider the
prior case of the crate root again. The use statement is resolved.
Assume the crate root has only one child module. Assume as well this
child module is a leaf module. Suppose this child module contains a use
statement pointing to the crate root. The module resolves this use
statement by adding all items from the root module. That will merge anew
its own items. But deduplication will remove them during merging. The
module-wide pass system will then check for changes in the tree. It will
see there were changes. So it will trigger another pass. This will
repeat the same steps. But the use statement in the crate root will
already cause deduplication to remove both the child module and its own
items from the child module. The same thing will happen in the child
module. This seems trivial. But it may very well be the solution. More
thought has to be put into test cases. There are likely edge cases that
this does not consider. The current data structures are a potentially
subpar fit for the task. That should be the task of benchmarks. A recap
of the plan is in order. The idea is to perform module-wide passes.
These happen at the top-level resolution proposition. The termination
check should also be moved there. The check should not base itself off
of a diff of use statements. The check is over the entire tree. This
implies need for a copy of the module tree. That would have happened
anyway. That is because of the pure nature of the computations.
Discussion about other areas is in order. The single-module resolution
proposition should change. It should now be simpler. The pass system
does not exist anymore there. A single resolution should be made. Though
this should continue to be followed up by use of the merge proposition.
The other areas of the current revision can be left as-is. Path
manipulation will come in very handy. The current merging strategy is
key to the new algorithm. That should likely be left unchanged. A more
complex test case must be thought up. The test cases should change.
They've all had the same shape thus far. Consider the case of an
absolute use statement. Suppose it is found in some arbitrarily deep
module. Then suppose every other module has a reexport to it. The first
pass would import the module over to all other modules. This pass would
also resolve the absolute use statement. Some modules would already
observe this. These would be the descendants to the former. A second
pass would then be performed. There have been changes in the first pass.
That is why a second pass would be in order. The second pass would go
through the same use statements anew. This is where deduplication comes
in. The same use statements would be resolved anew. Deduplication would
remove duplicate items. The import to the denoted module would be kept.
These are key. An observation can be made about this algorithm. The
amount of work per module-wide pass is fixed in some ways. The number of
use statements considered is always the same. Dependent use statements
will not be resolved. They will once their dependency exists no more.
That is the one way in which work varies across passes. This can be
modeled in terms of a set of sentences. These sentences await
satisfiability. Satisfiability of some sentence depends on
satisfiability of some other sentence. Dependent sentences are defined
as such. At least one sentence must be dependency-free. This triggers
resolution of other sentences. There is an exception here. Some
sentences are unresolvable. And yet they appear as dependent. These
correspond with use statements from third-party crates. The algorithm
relies not on these. Unresolvable sentences are eventually skipped. The
algorithm has no notion of unresolvable sentences. It only ever
determines dependency of sentences. It does not determine which are the
dependencies. A dependent use statement can not be immediately resolved.
Some name in its path does not currently exist. At one point it may
exist. It is unknown whether that point is reachable. The diff
comparison determines if it may be reachable. An observable change in
the tree indicates further resolution is in order. No observable change
indicates no further resolution is possible. The diff thus determines if
some dependent sentence is satisfiable. It does not determine which
sentence is satisfiable. The algorithm always goes through all
sentences. It attempts to satisfy each sentence in turn. Some may yield
observable change. Some may not. Termination follows when there is no
observable change at all. Discussion is needed of the new machinery this
algorithm needs. Resolution of bidirectional use statements needs access
to the entire module tree. The stateful module in the
reexport-resolution proposition is not enough. There is need for the
entire module tree. This should reflect the most up-to-date snapshot.
That can be found after each single-module resolution. This was already
explored in the latest revision of the Idris proof. The depth-first
approach in the single-module resolution proposition must be kept. There
is now need for this to carry state. The state should consist of the
module tree snapshot. The seed should be the same as the module to
resolve. This means the initial module is the crate root. So should the
stateful module tree be. Then the single-module resolution proposition
can use this alongside the single-reexport resolution proposition. The
latter will need to add another piece of state. The state is now
composed of the parent module and the entire module tree. Note the
module tree state need not change across each reexport resolution. It
changes once the merging proposition is triggered. That will need
another auxiliary proposition. It should observe the changes in a given
subtree. Then it should effect those in a new crate module tree. The
details of the single-reexport resolution proof need discussion. This
may now support path keywords. These include: crate, super and self. A
review of the Rust reference may be in order. These are the only
keywords that must be considered. The syn use tree does not include
special support for any of these. That likely means they are to be used
as identifiers. The syn documentation on identifiers mentions that.
Keywords will be parsed as identifiers. A manually-constructed
identifier may not be a keyword. The logic is then simplified. The
basecase for names needs modification. It should check whether the
identifier refers to a keyword. This also affects the rename case. The
check will need to consult the syn documentation. Maybe there is already
a utility proposition for keywords. There is none. The string conversion
utility will be used instead. This should yield reasonable results. The
case is of a single identifier. There should be no need for
sanitization. This is a good opportunity for implementation. A change to
the above cases will not affect the prior revision of the algorithm. The
self keyword requires no module tree state. It may be readily
implemented. The current proof takes into account solely a lookup into
the container. The revised version should check for keywords. The only
feasible keyword to implement at present is the self keyword. This
should come before the lookup in the item container. Recall the current
stateful module corresponds exactly to the self module. A resolution
follows immediately if the self module is brought over. The question
becomes the format of the item container packed in the resolution item.
Should it be a virutal container? Yes. self imports no immediate set of
items. It only brings over a module. The simplest next keyword to parse
is the crate keyword. That keyword is meant to be the source of an
absolute import path. Is that supposed to mean anything to the
algorithm? Yes. The place where it is checked can not be any place. self
also can not be checked only in the name case. It also has to be checked
in the rename case. The case for paths also needs to consider it. That
makes it notable in all cases. Sanitification is not necessary.
Well-formed input is expected. The case for renames need some more
attention. The current logic for renames could be reused. It is the same
for both the lookup and the self case. The lookup first finds a module.
Then it decides to modify the path of the module. Then it manipulates
the paths of all items in the subtree rooted at that module. The idea is
the same. It may be feasible to have a closure do this. It would get
passed an arbitrary module to rename. The case of a path requires
further discussion. The self keyword may appear at the start of the
path. It may also appear at the end of a path. The latter matches
against the name basecase during reexport resolution. Well-formed input
does not contain a self module in the middle of a path. Or does it? It
does not. A diagnostic reports just this. The self keyword may only
appear as a starting or ending segment in a path. Well-formed input is
guaranteed here. That should precede the lookups. The self keyword
indicates to carry through with the same stateful module. This will not
use the utility macro. That questions the approach used in that macro.
Though one thing is clear. The lookup should go after the self check.
The new state is now conditionally determined. It can be the same old
state if the path head is the self keyword. It can be the result of the
lookup if the path head is not the self keyword. Discussion is merited
to support other keywords. That check in paths will eventually consider
also the super and crate keywords. The check will have to be expanded.
Though the same strategy should be feasible. The new state is
conditionally defined. It is the current module in the self case. It is
the parent module in the super case. It is the module tree in the crate
case. This makes it obvious there is need for the module tree as state.
The crate case would make both pieces of state become the module tree.
The next step seems to be to add support for the new state. This now
comprises the crate-wide module tree. The first thing that needs
modification is the top-level loop. This should be removed from the
single-module resolution proof. Though there is no obvious proposition
for global resolution. It seems like the place to put this is the
parsing entrypoint for the item container. That would be subpar. A
better approach may be to abstract that away into another proposition.
That proposition would perform the global passes. That should leave the
parsing entry point unmodified. The global resolution proposition should
never be called recursively. That should ensure one can reason about the
crate module as the only consumer of the proposition. The proof should
call into the proposition that performs one pass over the entire module
tree. The implication of that is another module. This is guaranteed to
be the post-pass state of the crate root. Then the diffing step should
come. This is a diff between the pre-pass and post-pass states of the
whole module tree. This comparison proposition needs discussion. It
should compare the shape of the tree. Maybe an automatically derived
PartialEq implementation will do. It will not. That would also take into
consideration the current_module field used at parse-time. Something
similar would be convenient. The proposition for equality would then
"write itself." A comparison of aliases would do. Then would follow a
comparison of records. And then a comparison of all other fields. Except
for the parse-time utility field. That should do the trick. This assumes
there are PartialEq implementations for the types used for items. That
does not necessarily hold. Though those should be feasible. Those
implementations seem done now. A comparison of a tree should trigger a
recursive comparison of the entire tree. Though note this is exposed as
a separate proposition. The driver seems to be now ready. The next thing
should be to change the state passed to the single-pass proposition.
This needs to now also pass the module tree in whole. That should be
seeded with the same value as is currently used for the crate root. This
awards a dedicated proposition. It should gather within it the state as
a subtree and the whole-crate module tree. This should also make up the
implication of a single resolution pass. Then it follows that there
exists a new state after each child module is processed. This calls for
a fold instead of a map. The fold implies a product of identity
functors. The pair is comprised of an updated state and a resolved list
of child modules. The updated state itself reflects the state carried
across passes. The resolved list represents the previously mapped list
of child modules. There is something unnecessary here. There is no need
to have a duplicate list of updated child modules. It is enough that the
stateful pair carries the subtree and the state. Except it is not. The
subtree in the stateful pair refers not to the module from which the
child modules spawned. There is need to reconstruct a new module. This
should hold the resolved child modules. Then comes resolution of the
module itself. This should hold this newly constructed module. The other
half of the pair should hold the stateful module tree from the fold over
the list of child modules. The proposition for single-module resolution
should now take a stateful pair. The list of resolutions need not carry
with it an updated whole-crate state. That changes only after a pass
over a given module is done. Discussion of the single-reexport
resolution proposition will be delayed for later. The next step follows
back in the single-pass proposition. The proof now has a set of
resolution items. It needs to merge those with the module currently at
hand. Then it needs to deduplicate the items. The last thing is to
update the stateful module tree. Merging already has a dedicated
proposition. Deduplication also has a dedicated proposition. Whole-crate
module tree updates do not. That will require more work than the
equality proposition. The goal is to find a subtree in the crate tree.
Recursive updates are not necessary. The subtree need only update the
data of the subtree's root. That will be justified now. The simplest
case is a leaf node. These are resolved first. That is thanks to the
depth-first approach taken in the single-pass proposition. The
whole-crate module tree is updated here as well. The update would find
the leaf module. Then it would update its items. The leaf has no child
modules. So the only updated items are non-modules. The whole-crate
module now contains an updated leaf. Say it now goes to this leaf's
parent module. Suppose this parent module contains one other child
module. Further suppose that this other child is also a leaf. The
whole-crate module tree would be updated anew. Then it would reflect
both resolved child modules. Then comes the time to resolve the parent
module. One could attempt to resolve it and its children. There is no
need for the latter. There may be one exception to this. The module may
now have new child modules. That does not change one basic fact. The
module ought be found in the whole-crate tree. Then it needs to have its
items replaced with the updated module's items. That should get the job
done every time. A recap is in order. The proposition should assume one
module. Then it should assume another module. One is the crate root. The
other is the subtree. The subtree could also be the crate root. It is
best if a pass pair is passed instead. Though it should not imply a pass
pair. It should only imply a module. That should be the updated
whole-crate module tree. There is a problem in this approach. The
proposition will be used inductively in its proof. That means a pass
pair would be misleading. One of the projections refers to the
whole-crate tree. The other does not. The proposition will be used with
some other module in the whole-crate tree. The proof is not entirely
clear. The destination module's path has to be checked with the source
module's path. A match means the latter's proof must be implied. A
mismatch means the former's children must be matched. This should be
done through a fold transform. Recall only one module matches. The fold
should be prone to termination. What should the fold's seed be? It is
known the source module will surely be found. That is not a guarantee
the type system understands. A dummy value should do. The handiest one
is the source module. This is incorrect. Recall the proposition performs
walks on the module tree. One such walk could hit a dead-end. Such a
dead-end would manifest itself in a leaf module. That should imply a
coproduct. Its injections should correspond with the identity functor
and an injective const functor. That should be the seed of the fold over
the list of child modules. This means the whole proposition should imply
the above coproduct. The proof is wrong. One should not fold over the
list of child modules. That would mean some modules are downright lost.
The simplest example is a one-level deep module tree. Suppose there are
an arbitrary number n of nodes. Assume n is greater than 1. Further
suppose that the update subtree is on of these child modules. The
current proof would discard both the root module and the sibling module.
The proof should map over the list of child modules. Then it should
imply the mismatched module with the updated children. One of those
children modules will have matched the source module. That should do it
for the single-pass proposition. The next thing should be the
single-reexport proposition. Each case will be discussed in turn. The
name basecase can only ever refer to self and super. The self case is
covered. A similar macro could be elaborated for the super case. Is
super really possible in the name basecase? It can not. Can the crate
keyword appear alone? Not the case. The only one that can appear as a
basecase is the self keyword. The crate keyword can only appear at the
start of a path. The super keyword can only appear in the rename case.
It is otherwise a segment head in a larger path. The rename case for a
super keyword should access the module right above the current one. That
means there is need for an auxiliary proposition. That proposition
should assume the whole-crate module tree. It should also assume a path.
It should then look for that path in the module tree. Then there should
be need for another auxiliary proposition. This should get the parent
path to some module. It should assume a module subtree. It should imply
a path. That will then be used in the assumption for the prior
proposition. The proof for the parent path is fairly simple. It should
take a certain number of segments from the assumed module's path. The
number should correspond with one fewer segment than the path contains.
The proposition to fetch a given module should first match on the path
of the subtree with the target path. A mismatch indicates it should fold
over the module's child paths. The fold should be prone to termination.
